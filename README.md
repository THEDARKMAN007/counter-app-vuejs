### project features
Created a new vue js application using the cli.

Setup a counter composable with increment, decrement, reset, setValue functions with a valid UI.

Implemented vuex for state management. 

The functionality was housed in a page with route - ‘/counter’ any other route redirects the user to a 404 page handled by a wildcard route.
